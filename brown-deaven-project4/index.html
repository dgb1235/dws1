					<p>I would like to give a brief summary of Ferruccio Lamborghini's life based on information I have found on <a href= "http://www.lambocars.com/lambonews/ferruccio_lamborghini_a_biography.html">lambocars.com</a>.</p>
					<h2>Summary</h2>
					<!--Make a blockquote containing information gathered on mentioned website-->
					<blockquote>
						<p id="column1of3">Born April 28, 1916, Ferruccio Elio Artur Lamborghini grew up into a family of farmers but he knew he wanted to do 
						some thing with mechanics. He began by tinkering with his father's tractors and ended up attending a technical school in Bologna. 
						Ferruccio joined the Italian Air Force where he became a prisoner of war and was put to work in the British military motoring 
						department.</p>
						<p id="column2of3">After the war Ferruccio returned home and started converting old war surplus material into tractors for local farmers in a garage. 
						The business took off so he had to be moved to a larger facility and by 1949 he founded <i>Lamborghini Trattrice</i> which became known 
						as having the best tractors in Italy. This business made him very wealthy so he also started a factory building air-conditioning 
						and central heating equipment making him one of the richest men in Italy.</p>
						<p id="column3of3">After running into problems with the clutch in his Ferrari, Ferruccio swapped it out with a clutch in his tractors. It may have been this that
						led Lamborghini to start his next business, building Gran Turismo cars. Ferruccio wanted to build a smooth running V12 GT; however,
						things took a turn for the worse and he decided to sell most of his interest in his companies and retire to his estate near Perugia.
						It was at this estate where he had a state of the art winemaking facility and could produce over 800,000 bottles of wine each year. s
						Automobili Lamborghini SpA would later be taken over by Chrysler and on February 20, 1993 Ferruccio would breathe his last breath.
						Ferruccio is survived by his son, Tonino, who named his son in memory of his beloved father.</p>
